# Tile Game Engine #

### From **Manic Miner** to **Monty** to **Mario**, the tile-based jumping game has always been a blast to play. ###

This flash / AS3 project provides a fast, barebones engine in a clean, optimized and extensible fashion.

Current features:
  * A nicely animated Player
  * Enemies - walkers, jumpers, floaters, flyers… and Boss types
  * Multiple Rooms - with robust logic, so killed enemies stay dead, and items don’t reappear
  * Moving platforms - so nice that the monsters also travel on them
  * Moving pavements
  * Sloped tiles
  * Destructible tiles
  * Bounce tiles
  * Bullets - harms player or enemies
  * Effects - points, puffs, impacts and weather effects. These really add life to the game
  * Items - coins and special items… Static or animated
